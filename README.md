# Banking


In this challenge we were asked to create a banking API with different kind of accounts, users and functionalities.

### User
The system comes with 5 users loaded:
- User: adim, Pass: admin
- User: user1, Pass: user
- User: user2, Pass: user
- User: user3, Pass: user
- User: user4, Pass: user

All routes are protected and you must use a user to access them.
